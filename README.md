## Goal

This repo contains code inspired by the following [state of the art neural network architecture](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/Q16-1026) for the task of named entity recognition in MXNet.

## Running the code

1. Download and unzip the dataset into `./data/`
2. Preprocess the data: `$ cd ./src` & `python preprocess.py`
3. Set hyperparameters in `./src/config`
4. Train the model: `$ cd ./src` & `python preprocess.py`
